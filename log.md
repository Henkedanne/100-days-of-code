# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started with a TODO app. Got a basic layout in place and a way to add items.

**Thoughts:** Stuggled a bit with how to get the userinput to display in a list. Started with pushing all to an array but changed that later on and things worked better. 

**Link to work:** [TODO](http://www.example.com) <-- add link
