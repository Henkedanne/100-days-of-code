# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started with a TODO app. Got a basic layout in place and a way to add items.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a bit with how to get the userinput to display in a list. Started with pushing all to an array but changed that later on and things worked better.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Did steps on FreeCodeCamp. From 217 -> 234.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a lot with step 224! Could not get my grip around it for ages it seemed, but once I understod it it was so obvious of course. The challange was to translate a case switch to a object table, and access the same keys.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Continued on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** A real struggle with 235! Finally got it to work. I Managed to mix up the attribute name in the function with the key in the object. Thought .hasOwnProperty was what I should use to check both cases. But I was supposed to match the attr against the key. (Not check if that key was there. (like .hasOwnProperty does)).

### Day 4: January 8, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Continued on FreeCodeCamp,  Started Algorithm Challenges!

**Thoughts:** "Check for Palindromes was fun". First I made it so that it would split the string in two( at half way), then reverse it, and check if it match then first half. It worked, but not with odd length strings... Then it struck me that I only needed to reverse the string and check against its ordinary state. =P. oh well..

### Day 17: January 28, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Found a way finally to randomize a number and make it not appear twice in a row.

**Thoughts:** I asked HÃ¥kan for help, but before gave him the code to take a look, I scratch my initial idea, which was to randomize a number and then setup some sort of flags that could check if the number hade been used before. I went with the array model instead. Where u set up an empty arr, and check if empty, fill it with x.length. then randomize a index based on the arr.length. use that index to pick the rand number in the arr and then slice the arr unding the same index. 
The only problem is that there can be duplicates when the array refills.(!)

### Day 23: 19 February, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Problems with http and https

**Thoughts:** Found out that you now need https to be able to use geolocation. But fetching the api that is http, while coming from https is not allowed. Solved it by running the api through a reversed proxy. (https://cors.now.sh/)
