# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started with a TODO app. Got a basic layout in place and a way to add items.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a bit with how to get the userinput to display in a list. Started with pushing all to an array but changed that later on and things worked better.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Did steps on FreeCodeCamp. From 217 -> 234.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a lot with step 224! Could not get my grip around it for ages it seemed, but once I understod it it was so obvious of course. The challange was to translate a case switch to a object table, and access the same keys.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Continued on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** A real struggle with 235! Finally got it to work. I Managed to mix up the attribute name in the function with the key in the object. Thought .hasOwnProperty was what I should use to check both cases. But I was supposed to match the attr against the key. (Not check if that key was there. (like .hasOwnProperty does)).

### Day 4: January 8, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Continued on FreeCodeCamp,  Started Algorithm Challenges!

**Thoughts:** "Check for Palindromes was fun". First I made it so that it would split the string in two( at half way), then reverse it, and check if it match then first half. It worked, but not with odd length strings... Then it struck me that I only needed to reverse the string and check against its ordinary state. =P. oh well..
