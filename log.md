# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started with a TODO app. Got a basic layout in place and a way to add items.

**Thoughts:** Stuggled a bit with how to get the userinput to display in a list. Started with pushing all to an array but changed that later on and things worked better. 

**Link to work:** [TODO](https://github.com/Henkedanne/TODO)

### Day 2: January 6, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished 11 steps on FreeCodeCamp. From 217 -> 228.
**Thoughts:** Stuggled a lot with step 224! Could not get my grip around it for ages it seemed, but once I understod it it was so obvious of course. The challange was to translate a case switch to a object table, and access the same keys.
